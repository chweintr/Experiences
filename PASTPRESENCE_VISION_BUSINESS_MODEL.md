# PastPresence Vision and Business Model Overview

Status: Draft v0.1  
Date: February 14, 2026

## 1) Top-Level Vision

**PastPresence** is the parent storytelling company.  
Its core thesis: people want meaningful conversation experiences that feel authored, situated, and emotionally real.

PastPresence operates a shared conversational narrative platform across three distinct brands:

1. **Echoes Projects**  
Locale-specific and culture-specific conversation experiences (examples: *Echoes of Indiana*, *Echoes of Upsallam*, *Echoes of Appalachia*, *Echoes of Anatolia*).
2. **Reading Companions**  
Book/author-adjacent conversational companions (example: *Vonnebot*).
3. **HEARSAY Experiences**  
Original interactive fiction experiences (example: *The Knock* at [hearsayexperiences.com](https://www.hearsayexperiences.com/)).

## 2) Brand Architecture and Role

| Brand | Primary User Promise | Core Customer | Primary Format |
|---|---|---|---|
| PastPresence (parent) | Coherent ecosystem of authored conversational experiences | Partners, investors, collaborators | Company + platform |
| Echoes Projects | Talk with voices rooted in place, time, and memory | Cultural orgs, tourism, education, history-curious audiences | Place/history conversation experiences |
| Reading Companions | Converse with literary-thinking companions that deepen reading | Readers, students, educators, book communities | Author/book-inspired companions |
| HEARSAY Experiences | Enter dramatic narrative encounters through voice | Narrative/gaming audiences, festival audiences | Fiction-first conversation experiences |

## 3) Shared Platform Strategy

All three brands share a common core:

- Character and memory orchestration layer
- Voice, turn-taking, and latency stack
- Authoring workflow (prompting, constraints, narrative state)
- Safety and moderation rules
- Analytics and conversion tracking

This reduces marginal cost per new experience and creates a portfolio flywheel:

1. New content launches improve tooling.
2. Better tooling speeds future launches.
3. More launches increase audience and data.
4. Larger audience improves distribution and monetization.

## 4) Business Model (Portfolio Level)

PastPresence should run a **hybrid B2C + B2B model**:

- **B2C:** paid access to experiences and companion subscriptions
- **B2B:** institutional licensing, educational packages, and custom commissions
- **IP extension:** adaptation rights (audio, film, live events, publishing)

## 5) Monetization by Brand

### Echoes Projects

- Institutional license fees (museums, libraries, universities, tourism boards)
- Sponsored local editions (foundations, city/cultural grants)
- Premium public access passes (individual users where applicable)

### Reading Companions

- Consumer subscription (monthly/annual)
- Classroom/site licenses for schools and programs
- Premium companion packs (specialized voices/themes)

### HEARSAY Experiences

- Per-experience access (ticket model)
- Season pass / membership across multiple experiences
- Festival/venue partnerships and premium live activations

## 6) Go-To-Market Plan

### Phase 1: Prove Demand (0-6 months)

- Prioritize **HEARSAY** and 1-2 flagship launches
- Build waitlist and conversion funnel from `hearsayexperiences.com`
- Capture testimonials, retention data, and narrative engagement metrics

### Phase 2: Expand Portfolio (6-12 months)

- Launch first **Echoes Projects** pilot with one institutional partner
- Release first paid **Reading Companion** with clear educational/reader value
- Introduce shared account + cross-brand bundle offers

### Phase 3: Scale and Systematize (12-24 months)

- Replicate Echoes pilots to new geographies
- Grow recurring subscription revenue from Reading Companions
- Produce HEARSAY slate cadence (episodic/seasonal schedule)

## 7) Key Metrics

- Activation: first completed meaningful conversation/session
- Retention: 7-day and 30-day return rate
- Monetization: conversion to paid, ARPU, churn
- Content efficiency: time/cost to launch a new experience
- B2B traction: number of institutional pilots and renewal rate

## 8) Operating Model

Recommended lean structure:

1. Creative Direction (worlds, voice, narrative quality)
2. Product/Engineering (platform, reliability, tooling)
3. Partnerships (institutions, education, cultural orgs)
4. Growth/Editorial (audience development, launch ops)

Short-term priority is not headcount scale; it is **repeatable launch quality**.

## 9) Strategic Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk:** Experience novelty without durable retention  
  **Mitigation:** episodic content design, continuity hooks, and progression.
- **Risk:** Brand confusion across 3 lines  
  **Mitigation:** explicit brand architecture and clear landing-page pathways.
- **Risk:** Dependence on model providers and cost volatility  
  **Mitigation:** model abstraction layer, quality/cost benchmarking, fallback tiers.
- **Risk:** Trust/safety or historical/literary authenticity concerns  
  **Mitigation:** bounded character rules, source transparency, human editorial review.

## 10) 90-Day Action Plan

1. Finalize narrative brand architecture copy for all three brands.
2. Publish a simple parent-level `pastpresence.io` overview page linking to each brand.
3. Define pricing tests for HEARSAY (single experience vs season pass).
4. Run one Echoes partner discovery sprint (10-20 qualified outreach targets).
5. Launch one Reading Companion MVP with clear success criteria.
6. Build a shared KPI dashboard across all active experiences.

## 11) Positioning Statement (Draft)

PastPresence creates authored conversational worlds where people speak directly with stories, voices, and historical memory.  
Across Echoes Projects, Reading Companions, and HEARSAY Experiences, we turn conversation into a new medium for culture, literature, and narrative play.
