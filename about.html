      <h1>About HEARSAY</h1>

      <p class="lead">
        Somewhere between a novel, a play, a movie, a mystery, a dream, a confession, and a communion.
      </p>

      <p>
        HEARSAY is a series of conversational experiences. No puzzles. No right answers. Just unreliable narrators and the stories they tell.
      </p>

      <p>
        You speak with fictional characters who listen, respond, remember, and sometimes lie. Each experience places you in a specific scenario with a reason to talk to someone through a constrained frame: a peephole, a mirror, a screen, a window.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you believe them is up to you.
      </p>

      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>
        You'll use your microphone to speak with the characters. They hear you, they respond, and the conversation unfolds. Each character has their own voice, their own knowledge, their own secrets. Some of what they tell you is true. Some of it isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
        The experiences are designed to be replayed. Different characters reveal different parts of the story. The truth, if there is one, emerges from the gaps between their accounts.
      </p>

      <h2>Technology</h2>
      <p>
        HEARSAY uses real-time conversational AI with custom character engines, voice synthesis, and authored narrative constraints. The system allows characters to improvise within the boundaries of their knowledge, personality, and goals.
